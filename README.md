## Why a Fish Tank?  

When I started this project, I was looking at the shape of my laptop screen and thinking about all the everyday objects that share that same rectangle. I wanted something that would fill the screen and feel immersive, but not feel tied to technology like a TV or a phone.  

I’ve always done this with shapes, taking one thing and imagining it as something else. As a kid, I used to play with my Nintendo DS and watch how the silhouette on my wall changed as I held it different ways. To me it wasn’t just a DS, it was also a makeup compact, a cell phone, even the roof of a dollhouse.  

The fish tank idea came from that same place. By reimagining the screen as a tank, it turns into a little world you can look into and feel surrounded by, instead of just another rectangle on a desk.
